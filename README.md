## Description ##
The sinking of the RMS TITANIC is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this problem, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.


In this project, you will create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features, such as sex and age. Start with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until you are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data.

## Installation ##
This project requires ***Python 2.7*** and the following Python libraries installed:

* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Run ##
Template code is provided in the notebook `titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb` notebook file. Additional supporting code can be found in `titanic_visualizations.py`.

Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `titanic_survival_exploration/` and run one of the following commands:
`ipython notebook titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb` or  ` jupyter notebook titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb `
This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
